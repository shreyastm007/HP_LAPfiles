1==>Formik is designed to manage forms with complex validation with ease. 
    Formik supports synchronous and asynchronous form-level and field-level validation. 
    Furthermore, it comes with baked-in support for schema-based form-level validation through Yup. 

    Validation-->Form validation in React allows an error message to be displayed if the user has not correctly filled out the form with the expected type of input.

2==> the dev server used in React project

    Webpack dev server 
    it is a separate package that needs to get install via NPM. 
    Webpack dev server should ONLY be used for development. 

3==>How to create axios instance

    Instal axios using npm i axios --save-dev command
    syntax:const variable_name=axios.create({object})
   
    example:-const instance = axios.create({
              baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',
              timeout: 1000,
              headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'}
              });


4==>Fragments:-
    Fragment is a common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements.
    Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

    ex: <React.Fragment>
        <ChildA />
        <ChildB />
        <ChildC />
        </React.Fragment>


5==>ErrorBoundary
   Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree
   log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
   Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
   So error boundaries only catch errors that occur in a lifecycle method, render method, and inside Hooks like useEffect.

    to handle errors in react
    A static method called getDerivedStateFromError , which is used to update the error boundary's state.
    A componentDidCatch lifecycle method for performing operations when our error boundaries catch an error, such as logging to an error logging service. 


6==>What are Limitations of ErrorBoundary ? 
    Error boundaries do not catch errors for:
        Event handlers 	
	Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
	Server side rendering
	Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

    rendering, 
    in lifecycle methods, 
    and in constructors of the whole tree below them.


ASYNC AWAIT
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it.
The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style
