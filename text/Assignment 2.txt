1==>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. 
    It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. 
    It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code).
    It is easy to create a template using JSX in React.
    the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code.
    We use Babel compiler to convert the jsx code into the browser understandable code.

    example:-const mobiles = ["one+", "realme", "redmi", "iphone", "samsung"];
             const loopingData = mobiles.map((value) => {
             return <h1>{value}</h1>;
              });

3==>CLASS COMPONENT
    ---------------
   The component name shuold be written in pascal case
   must contain the class keyword.
   render() method is mandatory.
 ex:- class Home extends React.Component{
      render(){
        return(
               <div>
                    <h1>Hello</h1>
               </div>
              )};


4==>Functional Components
    =====================
   The component name should be written in pascal case.
   It has function keyword.
   render() method will not be there in this component.
  ex:- function Home(){
         return(
                <div>
                     <h1>this is header<h1>
                </div>
               );
             } 


5==>PROPS(properties)
    -----
   Props are arguments passed into React components.
   React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
   ex:-
       function Car(props) {
       return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
       }

6==>DIFF B/W CLASS COMPO AND FUNC COMPO
    
                   FUNCTIONAL                                                           CLASS
    There is no render method used in functional components.	      It must have the render() method returning JSX 
    
    before 16.8 it is called as stateless                             it is known as statefull

    Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make         It requires different syntax inside a class component to implement hooks.
    them Stateful.


7==>DIFFING ALGO
    
   When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one.
   This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm.

   With the help of this Algorithm React figures out which components in the UI needs to be updated. 
   This process is called diffing. The algorithm that is used for the diffing process is called as the diffing algorithm.

   complexities:-
   Generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another have a complexity in the order of O(n^3) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. 
   React relies on two assumptions to solve this problem that is in a linear time - O(n)

8==>BABEL-> Babel converts the JSX code to javascript code
            The browser cannot understand the jsx code, babel will convert the jsx 
code into browser understandable code.
 
9==>KEY ATTRIBUTE
    A “key” is a special string attribute need to include when creating lists of elements in React.
    we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.

    To avoid the warning like  Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
