REACT JS

1==>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    React is used to build single-page applications.
    React allows us to create reusable UI components.

2==>why react??
    react is a single page application.
     its potential to reuse components.

3==>diff b/w framework and lib
    Framework is collection of one or more files which does a specific job
    Library is subset of framework,it can only handle a specific subtask.

4==>React-React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a declarative, 
component-based paradigm and aims to be both efficient and flexible.
    ReactDOM-React package for working with the DOM.
    By using ReactDOM.render() it will render the data to the DOM.

5==>how to create react elements
    let variable_name=React.createElement("element",null,"data");
    example:-let reactElement=React.createElemnt("h1",null,"hello");
    null can be a object.

6==>VDOM- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or
 “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM 
by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

7==>diff b/w REALDOM AND VDOM
    In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.”
    A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy. 
    A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object,
 but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen.
    Manipulating the DOM is slow. 
    Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because we will make changes in the copy of realDOM.

8==>Single page App: the browser will only rerender the content without refreshing the website.

9==>BABEL->Babel converts the JSX code to javascript code
            The browser cannot understand the jsx code, 
babel will convert the jsx code into browser understandable code.
