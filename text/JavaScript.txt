1-->JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. 
    Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995 
    the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.
    It is created in 10 days.


    JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to 
create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user.
    JavaScript is known as a client-side scripting language. 
    Most Web applications, such as a search engine, work because of an 
interaction between the user's device (e.g. computer) and a remote server. 
    The software on the remote server sends information to the client 
(i.e. the user's machine) and the software on the client side reads the 
information and renders a Web page on screen.

    Nashorn: A JavaScript engine used in Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK)
    Hermes: developed by Facebook for React Native mobile apps
    Linear B: The ECMAScript engine of the Opera web browser versions 7.0 to 9.50
    Rhino: One of several JavaScript engines from Mozilla.
    Carakan: A JavaScript engine developed by Opera Software ASA.

3-->A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code.
     A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.

4-->JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
    The ECMAScript specification is a blueprint for creating a scripting language. JavaScript is an implementation of that blueprint. 
    On the whole, JavaScript implements the ECMAScript specification as described in ECMA-262.


5-->ECMA-It is an organisation -European Computer Manufacturer's Association.
    ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript, etc. It is a trademark scripting language specification.

6-->There are 2 data types in JS.
    1.Primitive Data Type
    2.Reference Data Type

1.Primitive Data Type-->String-"Hello World"
                        Number-3,3.2
                        Boolian-True,False
                        Undefined
                        Null
2.Reference Data Type-->Objects-Objects are the collection of key's and value pairs.
                        var obj={
                                  name:Akshata
                                  age:22
                                  address:Mangalore
                                 }

9-->undefined -is a variable that refers to something that doesn't exist, and the variable isn't defined to be anything. 
    null - is a variable that is defined but is missing a value.

7-->Without using new keyword
      var obj={
                 name:Akshata,
                 address:Mangalore,
                 age:22,
                 phno:9164559711
                 designation:Trainee Enginner;
               }
      console.log(obj)

8-->With using new keyword
      var obj=new obj
      obj1.name:Akshata,
      obj1.address:Mangalore,
      obj1.age:22,
      obj1.phno:9164559711
      obj1.designation:Trainee Enginner;
      console.log(obj1)
