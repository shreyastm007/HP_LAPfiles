Assignment 4
=============

1-->We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, 
which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, 
as you're probably used to. 
Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
A callback function is where the function is an argument to another function.

2==>Order of execution in JavaScript is dependent on the following components working 
together to pass and order information. 
      The Callstack
      The Event Loop
      The Task Queue. 
      WebAPIs/External Resources.

3==>null == 0; // -> false
    null > 0; // -> false
    null >= 0; // -> true
       
    1 < 2 < 3; // -> true
    3 > 2 > 1; // -> false

    [10, 1, 3].sort() // -> [1, 10, 3]

4==>A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.
    Time between the variable declaration and initialisation.

5==>mutable--changeable,modifiable
    example-reference data type-objects and arrays.
    Immutable--can't be changeable.
    example-primitive data type-string,number,boolian,null,undefined

6==>const num = [10, 20, 30];
    const n1 = num;
    console.log(num.slice(0));
    output:[10,20,30]

The scope of a var variable is functional scope.	       The scope of a let variable is block scope.	                   The scope of a const variable is block scope.
It can be re-initialized and re-declared into the scope.       It can be reinitialsed but cannot be re-declared into the scope.	   It cannot be reinitialised or re-declared into the scope.
It can be declared without initialization.	               It can be declared without initialization.	                   It cannot be declared without initialization.
It can be accessed without initialization 
   as its default value is “undefined”.	                       It can be accessed without initialization

9==>     slice-->The slice( ) method copies a given part of an array and returns that copied part as a new array. 
                 It doesn't change the original array. 
         splice( )--> method changes an array, by adding or removing elements from it.


10-->Both the methods are used to add elements to the array. 
     unshift() method adds the element at the start of the array.
     push() adds the element at the end of the array.

11==>Shift() and pop() methods are used to remove an element from an array. 
     The method shift() is used to remove the first element from an array 
     the pop() method is used to remove the last element from the array.
      
  The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements or adding new elements.
